# Continious Integration (unit testing)

In addition to this repository you also need another git repository corresponding to the git folder you want to run
unit tests for. I have created another repository called dummyProject. 

To test the functionality in this repository do the following:  
create a new folder  
//_in the new folder run:_   
git clone https://github.com/sondrtha/ContiniousIntegration.git  
git clone https://github.com/sondrtha/dummyProject.git  
cd ContiniousIntegration  
python main.py  
//_then make changes to files in the dummyProject folder and then commit in order to rerun tests_
